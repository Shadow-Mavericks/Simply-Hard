 *+	- Added +DECALUSESSPRITESCALE, which multiplies an actor's decal scale by the sprite scale. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
 *+	- FakeInventory actors can now make use of the "Activation" thing property, vastly increasing its utility. Allows the item to target the player collecting the item and vice/versa, or for the item itself to be the activator. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
 *-	- Send inventory that inherits from CustomInventory and Inventory on full update. Fixes issues where weapon checks for inventory fails for late-joining clients, or after a map change. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
++	- Hitting ice corpses now trigger damage events. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
 +	- Added A_JumpTo codepointer, which jumps to a state instantly & with prediction. Useful for jumping to an ancestor actor's state without the issues A_Jump with a 256 chance has. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
 +	- Added "hidelives = true/false" token to SBARINFO, allowing to disable the built-in lives display on the HUD. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
 +	- Backported A_WeaponOffset from ZDoom Revision 115dbd0, with alterations necessary for Zandronum's current codebase. [StrikerTheHedgefox]
